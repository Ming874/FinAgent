## üöÄ Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the files):**
    ```bash
    # If you have it in a git repo
    # git clone <your-repo-url>
    # cd <your-repo-name>
    ```
    If you only have the `app.py` file, create a new directory, place `app.py` inside it, and `cd` into that directory.

2.  **Create `requirements.txt`:**
    Create a file named `requirements.txt` in the same directory as your `app.py` and paste the following content into it:
    ```txt
    streamlit
    yfinance
    pandas
    plotly
    google-generativeai
    google-search-results
    ta

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
